Gumbo is a feral cat; he?s stinky, he?s scared of everything, and has a perpetually confused expression on his face.  He hangs around the neighbor?s porch on account of the free food that magically appears in a bowl every day?water too.   Gumbo is a big fan of this magic food, but such luxury comes at a price.  Roving marauder cat gangs, also attracted to the porch by food, attack frequently and drive him off.  Some days Gumbo goes without eating.

If ONLY Gumbo could find some human to take him inside?   Food, sleep, and no stress!  That?s the life?  But our fair Gumbo is not domesticated.  And frankly, a little off-putting.

The house adjacent to where Gumbo eats is the hoped for Utopia?clean, quiet, no other pets, and food galore!

Unfortunately, because Gumbo is often scared off the porch by the marauding cat gangs, he often hides underneath the adjacent home?s deck.  He?s scared so he?urinates?defecates.   The smell is not good.  And Gumbo is already dirty?  So when the owner of this house comes outside and smells this awful smell and sees this dirty cat, Gumbo gets chased away with a broom.

But still, Gumbo knows this house is where he should be.  His task: prove to this home owner that he can clean up and be a good pet.  Then Gumbo could spend stress free days living inside.
